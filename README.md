# Most Dangerous Writing App

Inspired by a Squibler application of the same name, this desktop app helps break writer's block by asking writers to quickly respond to prompts. 
If writers are idle for 5 seconds, all of their work is deleted, but if they can continuously write for one minute, they can save their masterpiece.
